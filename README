ZFS Zpools are a disaster if you accidentally fill them to capacity.  
Due to their Copy On Write (COW) nature, a full file system will not 
only be crippled in performance, but also may not even let you do any
real "deletes" to clear up space!  This script provides the means by
which you can begin freeing space back up in order to get to a 
reasonable zpool capacity (~90%), such that normal functions such as 
rm beging to work again.  

USE THIS SCRIPT AT YOUR OWN RISK

Update:  

I'm never going to update this to include the actual pieces that 
destroy data, because it would be irresponsible IMO without 
engineering a whole piece of software.  

I will leave some basic instructions for a DIY and posterity.

The script here is nothing more than a basic BASH script that walks 
through a given path recursively.  Because of the nature of ZFS, 
you cannot simply add some "rm -f" statements here, you need to 
actually clobber files by using something like "echo > $FILE_NAME".  

If that doesn't make sense to you, please don't try to do it.
